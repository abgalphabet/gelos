# Ninety-Nine **_Groovy_** Problem series

This is adaptation of the [Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) from [Phil Gold](http://aperiodic.net/phil/).

I use the ninety-nine problems as the material to deepen my _functional style_ programming knownledge in different programming languages.


The problems includes:

* [Working with lists](src/test/groovy/gordius/lists/ListsSpecification.groovy)
* Arithmetic
* Logic and Codes
* Binary Trees
* Multiway Trees
* Graphs
* Miscellaneous Problems


# About Gelos

>_[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelos_(mythology))_

>In Greek mythology, Gelos[pronunciation?] (Γέλως) is the divine personification of laughter. According to Philostratus the Elder, he was believed to enter the retinue of Dionysus alongside Comus.[1] Plutarch relates that Lycurgus of Sparta dedicated a small statue of Gelos to the god,[2] and elsewhere, mentions that in Sparta there was a sanctuary of Gelos, as well as those of Thanatos, Phobos "and other [personifications of] experiences of this kind".[3]

>Risus was the Latin rendition of the name Gelos. A festival in honor of Risus (i. e. Gelos) in Thessaly was described by Apuleius,[4] but it is unknown whether it was an actual event or writer's invention.[5]
